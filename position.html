  <!--With the padding we push some elements down by adding some space that can't be used inside of the body element -->

    <!--With position is css we can set the position of an element.
        With position: fixed, the element is fixed to floate above the page 
        and will always be at the top of the page. 
        With top we can set how much space there is between the element at the top of the browser window.
        The same goes for left, reight buttom.
        If you poth use left: 10px and reight: 10px, the element will streach to be both 10px from the reight and left.
        Not only that but these parts (buttom, reight and left) will change with the page. 
        But if you don't want that than use height and width so the element don't change-->
