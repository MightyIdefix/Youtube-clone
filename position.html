    <!--With position is css we can set the position of an element.
        With position: fixed, the element is fixed to floate above the page 
        and will always be at the top of the page. 
        With top we can set how much space there is between the element at the top of the browser window.
        The same goes for left, reight buttom.
        If you poth use left: 10px and reight: 10px, the element will streach to be both 10px from the reight and left.
        Not only that but these parts (buttom, reight and left) will change with the page. 
        But if you don't want that than use height and width so the element don't change
        If you want an element to be in fornt af an other, give it a high z-index.
        Elements will be in front of others if they have a higher z-index than them-->

          is placed in the sidebare element, which is fixed.

          This is very usefull when you fx want to make notification on an other element.-->

        postition: absolute is placed on the page 
        while position: fixed is placed in the browser window.
        When you scrole the elements placed on the page will move up
        while the elements in the browser window always will be shown.
        This element is coded after the header element and that's why it's
        placed in front of the header element.-->
